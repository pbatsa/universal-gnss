# Universal GNSS

Universal GNSS is a modular GNSS/RTK runtime stack designed for ROS 2, embedded systems, and RTK base stations.

The goal is to provide a vendor-agnostic GNSS layer capable of parsing, normalizing, configuring, and exposing GNSS data from multiple receiver families through a common runtime model.

## Current Project Status

`v0.6.0` is released.

Current phase: post-`v0.6.x` stabilization.

Current project state includes:

- Auto Discovery v2 plus `ReceiverNode` auto-discovery wiring
- Auto Configuration dry-run planning and operator-driven apply for supported
  families
- `ReceiverNode`, `NtripNode`, and `ReplayNode`
- parser counters plus malformed/rejected diagnostic visibility in ROS2
- live RTCM forwarding from `NtripNode` into `ReceiverNode`
- portable RTCM MSM correction-stream summary observability through the shared
  semantic monitor/tools surface
- ROS2 RTCM semantic diagnostics for base-station ARP, `1230`, and MSM summary
- additive portable dual-antenna baseline runtime/ROS2 surface:
  - capabilities:
    `dual_antenna_baseline`, `baseline_azimuth`, `baseline_pitch`,
    `baseline_length`, `baseline_solution_status`
  - runtime / `GnssStatus` fields:
    `dual_antenna_baseline`, `baseline_azimuth_deg`,
    `baseline_pitch_deg`, `baseline_length_m`,
    `baseline_solution_status`
  - compatibility fields:
    `heading_deg` and `dual_antenna_heading` remain during `v0.6.x`
- u-blox persistent FLASH configuration and output-port selection
- model-aware Unicore signal-group planning/profile selection with:
  - safe unknown-model fallback that skips `CONFIG SIGNALGROUP`
  - documented UM982 dual-antenna baseline gating
  - documented UM980 / UB9A0 single-antenna signal-group validation
  - explicit known non-baseline model selection for UM960 / UM981 without
    guessing undocumented signal-group mappings
- Unicore binary `N4` regression coverage for valid unknown-frame accounting,
  malformed/rejected decode handling, and ASCII/Binary portable-field
  consistency on shared `PVTSLN*` mappings
- UM982 / Unicore runtime field validation through downstream MowgliNext use
- decimal-degree latitude/longitude outputs preserving at least 9 decimal
  places

Current release guidance:

- live receiver writes do not occur unless `gnss_config_apply` is given
  explicit `--confirm` or `--yes`
- Unicore persistent apply is available through the reset/recovery workflow and
  remains an operator-driven path with manual rollback expectations
- Unicore `gnss_profile_preview`, `gnss_config_plan`, and `gnss_config_apply`
  accept an optional `--model` selector; when the model is unknown, the safe
  fallback skips `CONFIG SIGNALGROUP` and leaves the receiver's current
  signal-group configuration unchanged
- Unicore `factory_reset` live execution now uses the same reconnect / active
  probe recovery workflow
- stable `/dev/serial/by-id/*` paths are recommended over transient
  `/dev/ttyACM*` and `/dev/ttyUSB*` names whenever they exist
- UM982 runtime-only live apply should use an operator timeout around
  `--timeout-ms 5000`
- MowgliNext is treated as downstream field validation; GUI/install issues do
  not belong in the Universal GNSS core backlog unless they expose a missing
  portable feature or a bug in this repository

## Portable Receiver Profiles

The current portable receiver-configuration surface is:

- `runtime_only`
  - do not change receiver configuration
  - only open the receiver and parse its current output
- `rover_high_precision`
  - configure a conservative high-precision rover/runtime output profile
- `rover_high_precision_debug`
  - extend `rover_high_precision` with extra satellite / RF / hardware /
    correction diagnostics where supported
- `factory_reset`
  - model a receiver factory-reset workflow where the vendor support is known
  - requires explicit reconnect/recovery handling before normal profile apply resumes

Legacy aliases are still accepted by the current CLIs:

- `rover` -> `rover_high_precision`
- `diagnostics` -> `rover_high_precision_debug`

Current receiver-family support:

- Unicore
  - `runtime_only`
  - `rover_high_precision`
  - `rover_high_precision_debug`
  - `factory_reset` planning/preview/live recovery apply
  - model-aware signal-group planning:
    - `UM960` and `UM981` are known non-baseline models and stay conservative
      when signal-group mappings are undocumented
    - `UM982` may emit the documented dual-antenna rover selection
      `CONFIG SIGNALGROUP 3 6`
    - `UM980` and `UB9A0` expose documented explicit signal-group selections
      but do not auto-enable dual-antenna baseline groups
    - unknown/unconfirmed models skip `CONFIG SIGNALGROUP` and warn instead of
      guessing
- u-blox
  - `runtime_only`
  - `rover_high_precision`
  - `rover_high_precision_debug`
  - `factory_reset` currently reported as unsupported by the portable planner
- generic NMEA
  - `runtime_only` only
  - read-side RTK status can be inferred from standard `GGA fix_quality`

Safety note:

- receiver factory reset may change the active baud rate
- the current Unicore `FRESET` path returns the receiver to `115200 bps`
- the current Unicore recovery workflow uses an active `VERSIONA` query plus
  explicit `CONFIG COM1 921600 8 n 1` recovery before continuing the profile

Universal GNSS currently exposes this receiver-profile surface through:

- the module-level planner/profile API in `gnss_driver`
- the standalone `gnss_profile_preview`, `gnss_config_plan`, and
  `gnss_config_apply` CLIs
- downstream integration hooks for ROS2 nodes, launch files, and later
  project-specific onboarding or UI layers

## Goals

- Provide a portable GNSS core independent from ROS 2.
- Normalize GNSS runtime state across vendors.
- Support NMEA, RTCM3, u-blox UBX, Unicore, Quectel, and other protocols progressively.
- Expose consistent ROS 2 topics, services, and diagnostics.
- Support RTK rover and RTK base workflows.
- Keep parser, driver, transport, NTRIP, and ROS 2 layers separated.

## Non-goals

- Supporting every GNSS vendor message from day one.
- Replacing vendor tools for firmware updates.
- Mixing ROS 2 code into the portable parser core.

## Architecture

Current implemented layers:

- `gnss_core`
  - portable C++ runtime model
  - runtime aggregation of partial normalized updates
  - fix / RTK enums
  - capability and value flag system
  - canonical dual-antenna baseline fields plus `v0.6.x` heading compatibility
  - no ROS 2 dependency
- `gnss_protocols`
  - portable framing and checksum helpers
  - NMEA semantic parsing: `GGA`, `RMC`, `GSA`, `GSV`, `GST`, `VTG`, `ZDA`
  - standard `GGA fix_quality` -> normalized `rtk_mode` mapping for generic
    runtime-only receivers
  - UBX semantic parsing: `NAV-STATUS`, `NAV-PVT`, `NAV-DOP`, `NAV-SAT`,
    `MON-HW`, `MON-HW2`, `MON-RF`, `RXM-RTCM`, `ACK/NAK`
  - Unicore ASCII semantic parsing: `PVTSLNA`, `BESTNAVA`, `RTKSTATUSA`,
    `RTCMSTATUSA`, `SATSINFOA`, `BESTSATA`, `JAMSTATUSA`, `FREQJAMSTATUSA`,
    `HWSTATUSA`, `AGCA`
  - Unicore binary `N4` semantic parsing: `BESTNAVB`, `PVTSLNB`
  - RTCM3 framing, CRC24Q, message-type extraction/classification, and

  - ROS2 diagnostic projection of portable RTCM semantic observations for
    base-station ARP, GLONASS `1230`, and MSM summary/per-message activity
    without warning on well-formed `1230` messages that simply carry no valid
    GLONASS bias values
  - `ReplayNode` for hardware-free `status` / `fix` / `diagnostics` replay with
    optional `rtcm` publication from sanitized logs
  - `NtripNode` wrapper publishing diagnostics for ROS-side NTRIP state
  - serial / TCP / replay / combined launch examples

Later modules:

- `gnss_rtk_base`
  - survey-in, fixed-base workflows, RTCM routing
- `gnss_esp32`
  - lightweight embedded integration
